# SFDX Dreamhouse App

## Salesforce DX Packaging 2

> **Important:** Salesforce DX is available as a Beta release in Summer ‘17 but the Second-Generation Packaging (Packaging 2) feature is available on a limited basis as a Pilot release.  Salesforce DX isn’t generally available unless or until Salesforce announces its general availability in documentation or in press releases or public statements. All commands, parameters, and other features are subject to change or deprecation at any time, with or without notice. Don't implement functionality developed with these commands or tools. You can provide feedback or suggestions for Packaging 2 in the Pilot Chatter group.</td>
